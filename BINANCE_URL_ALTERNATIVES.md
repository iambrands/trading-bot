## 💡 Recommendation

Since you're in a restricted location:

**Don't worry about Binance URLs** - You don't need them right now!

1. ✅ **Your bot works with Coinbase** (already configured)
2. ✅ **Paper trading works** (doesn't need live API)
3. ✅ **Testing can continue** (Coinbase is fine)

**Focus on:**
- Testing your bot with Coinbase
- Monitoring signal generation
- Validating strategy performance
- Optimize for different exchanges later

## 🎯 Next Steps

### If Checking Deployment URL:
- Check your Railway dashboard
